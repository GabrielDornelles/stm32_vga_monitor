# stm32_vga_monitor

just a project to run data on a vga monitor from scratch (using a microcontroller).

An implementation of a basic video card to display data on vga monitor, generates vertical and horizontal syncronism and should send data through SPI into some resolutions (limited to resolutions that can be displayed using a 80mhz clock, which is the microcontroller clock). Didn't finish the project yet, vertical and horizontal pulses are implemented. code here might be really outdated, ill update when I get it done.
